## Brand Story

Frank's Auto Solutions is a no-nonsense tire shop on N Main Street in Baytown that has earned the loyalty of local drivers through straightforward service and fair pricing. Despite the name, the staff has built a reputation for honesty and reliability over more than a decade — customers who started coming ten years ago still trust Frank's for everything from quick flat repairs to full tire replacements. The shop doesn't promise flash, just results: radial patches in ten minutes, inspections without the wait, and tires that fit both your vehicle and your budget. In a town full of chain options, Frank's represents the independent shop that treats customers like neighbors — because in Baytown, they are.

## Target Customer

- **Local Baytown drivers searching on their phone mid-emergency** — flat tire, low pressure warning, need help NOW — the 10-minute repair reputation is critical for these searches
- **Budget-conscious vehicle owners** — customers explicitly praise the $10-$12 flat repair pricing and affordable tire options over chain store markups  
- **Plant/industrial workers commuting through Baytown** — the N Main St location serves plant workers on FM 565 and Highway 146 corridors who need reliable tire service near their route
- **Families with multiple vehicles** — reviews show multi-generational loyalty with customers bringing "the baby" and mentioning decade-long relationships
- **Truck and work vehicle owners** — heavy duty/off-road tire services attract contractors and workers who need specialty tires chain stores don't stock

## Competitive Context

Frank's Auto Solutions competes with major chains like Discount Tire, Firestone Complete Auto Care, and Pep Boys (located on Garth Rd), as well as independent shops like Tire Doctor and M&T Auto Repair. The nearest competitor is Pep Boys on Garth Rd, approximately 2 miles south. Frank's differentiates through speed (10-minute flat repairs cited vs. longer waits at chains), affordability ($10-$12 patches vs. chain pricing), and personal service built over 10+ years of community relationships. Unlike chains that require appointments or have long waits, Frank's operates on a walk-in model that serves stranded drivers and busy commuters who need immediate help.

## DESIGN & BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Everything below tells you HOW to build this site. Follow these instructions precisely.

```

---

### Design Direction

- **Industry:** Automotive / Tire Service — blue collar, practical, trustworthy
- **Tone:** No-nonsense, reliable, hardworking. This is a Main Street shop where the work speaks louder than the words. Think "your neighbor's garage, but professional" — unpretentious but competent.
- **Typography-led design.** The site should feel professional because of strong type hierarchy, generous whitespace, and intentional layout — NOT because of icons, card grids, or color fills.
- **Color palette:** Use a grounded, working-class palette. Think deep navy blues (#1a365d), clean whites, and a bold yellow or orange accent (#f6ad55) reminiscent of road signage. Avoid the generic navy+neon-red AI tire shop look. The palette should feel like a place that fixes cars, not a tech startup.
- **Photography:** Use a high-quality Unsplash image for the hero section (search: "tire shop," "auto mechanic," "car service garage," "mechanic working"). Apply a dark overlay so text is readable. A real photo instantly kills the "AI-made" look.

---

### CRITICAL — DO NOT DO THESE THINGS

These are the patterns that make AI-generated sites look amateur. Avoid every single one:

1. **No translateY hover float effects on cards.** Real sites don't make every element levitate on hover. Use subtle border-color changes or opacity shifts only on genuinely interactive elements (buttons, links).

2. **No icon-in-a-rounded-square as the repeated visual motif.** Do not put Font Awesome icons inside 48-52px colored/bordered squares and repeat that pattern in every section. If you use icons at all, use them inline with text or as small accents — not as the centerpiece of every card.

3. **No identical section structure repeated.** Do NOT use the same "pill tag → section title → subtitle → card grid" skeleton for every section. Each section should have its own distinct layout. Mix full-width sections, asymmetric two-column layouts, centered single-column text, large pull quotes, etc.

4. **No colored accent cards to indicate "featured" items.** Don't make one card dark navy and another card red to show importance. Use size, position, and typography weight to create hierarchy instead.

5. **No spinning SVG loader or themed loading animation.** Use a clean, minimal loading animation — a thin progress bar or a simple fade-in is more professional than a custom SVG animation.

6. **No "scroll mouse" indicator at the bottom of the hero.** This is an AI cliché. Remove it entirely.

7. **No generic Font Awesome icons as primary visual interest.** Icons like `fa-circle-notch`, `fa-wrench`, `fa-bolt` in colored boxes are the #1 tell of AI-generated sites. Use typography, photography, and layout instead.

8. **No frosted-glass / backdrop-filter cards floating over gradient backgrounds.** This is the most overused AI pattern. Use solid backgrounds, clean edges, and real content hierarchy.

9. **No letter-spacing: 1-2px uppercase tiny pill labels on every section.** One or two is fine. Every section having an identical "WHAT WE DO" / "ABOUT US" / "TESTIMONIALS" pill tag is a pattern.

10. **No emergency floating call button with a pulsing box-shadow.** Just make the phone number prominent in the nav and hero. A sticky bottom bar on mobile is fine but should be a clean, simple bar — not a floating circle with a glow.

---

### DESIGN PRINCIPLES — DO THESE INSTEAD

**Let typography carry the design.** Use a distinctive display font (not DM Sans, Inter, or Roboto — try something like Outfit, Sora, or General Sans for headings, paired with a clean body font). Use dramatic size contrast between headings and body text. A 56-72px hero heading paired with 16-17px body text creates natural hierarchy without any visual tricks.

**Use a real hero image.** Source from Unsplash. A dark overlay (`linear-gradient` with `rgba` black) over a real photo of a tire shop or mechanic at work instantly grounds the site in reality. The hero text sits on top.

**Give every section a different layout:**
- **Hero:** Full-viewport image background with overlay, large heading, subtitle, CTA buttons, and a row of 3 key stats ("10+ Years", "90+ Reviews", "10-Min Repairs")
- **Services:** Clean multi-column text list or minimal grid — NO icon boxes. Think of how a restaurant menu lists items, not how a SaaS landing page shows features.
- **About:** Asymmetric two-column with a large pull quote on one side and narrative text on the other.
- **Testimonials:** Large, editorial-style quotes — one at a time or staggered, not 5 identical cards in a grid. Think newspaper testimonial layout.
- **Location/Hours:** Clean split layout with a Google Maps embed on one side and hours + contact info on the other.
- **Contact form:** Simple, clean, minimal. No decorative wrappers.

**Whitespace is your primary design tool.** Sections should have generous padding (100-120px vertical on desktop). Content should never feel cramped. Let things breathe.

**Limit your color usage.** Use your accent color for CTAs and one or two emphasis moments only. Everything else should be your neutral palette (dark text on light backgrounds, light text on dark backgrounds). Restraint makes the accent color impactful.

**Mobile is the priority.** Most visitors will be on phones, probably stranded with a flat tire. The phone number should be immediately tappable. The site should be fast, clear, and usable at a glance on a 375px screen.

**Testimonials should feel real and important.** Use large quote marks (typographic, like a big `"` character), generous spacing, and let the words speak. Don't shrink them into tiny cards.

**The loading animation should be nearly invisible.** A thin bar across the top of the screen that fills and fades, or a simple full-screen fade-in. Nothing themed, nothing clever.

---

### Content Priorities (in order of importance)

1. **Phone number** — clickable, prominent, everywhere it matters
2. **"10+ years serving Baytown" + "90+ reviews"** — instant credibility
3. **"10-minute flat repairs"** — the speed differentiator that customers praise
4. **State Inspection services** — high-search-volume service
5. **Services list** — scannable, clear
6. **Testimonials** — "Frank's has always done us right" is powerful social proof
7. **Hours + Location + Map** — practical info
8. **Contact form** — lead capture
9. **Pricing transparency** — mention "affordable" per customer reviews

---

### Technical Requirements

- Fast load time — minimal dependencies, no heavy frameworks
- Google Fonts for typography (pick something distinctive, not the defaults)
- Font Awesome is acceptable for small inline icons (social links, phone icon in nav) but should NOT be the visual centerpiece of any section
